                    <p class="mb-4">Want to plump up your lips? Lip augmentation can improve the shape, structure and volume of your lips. All lip fillers are not created equal. Each one offers a slightly different benefit based on the size of the hyaluronic acid molecule and composition of the filler. </p>

                <h3>Before Being Treated With Derma Fillers</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">Your skin will be numbed with a topical anesthetic and there is anesthetic in the filler as well. It is normal to experience swelling and bruising for a few days/ 2 weeks after your procedure. To minimize these side effects consider doing these things pre-procedure:</p>
                <ul class="list-style-circle">
                    <li>Avoid taking aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, st johns wort, omega 3 fatty acids (fish oil) and vitamin e supplements 5 days prior to your procedure</li>
                    <li> Avoid alcohol for 24 hrs prior to your procedure.</li>
                    <li> Consider taking an antihistamine for 2 days before your procedure to decrease swelling.</li>
                    <li> Consider taking oral arnica for 2 days before your procedure to decrease bruising.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Risks Associated with Derma Filler Injections</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">Severe complications from dermal fillers are uncommon, however, we’d like you to be aware of them.  These risks may vary depending on the filler used and include:</p>
                <ul class="list-style-circle">
                    <li>Acne like skin eruptions</li>
                    <li> Asymmetry</li>
                    <li> Bruising and bleeding from the injection site, swelling</li>
                    <li>  Damage to the skin that results in a wound and possible scarring</li>
                    <li>  Infection and the injection site</li>
                    <li>  Lumps or palpable filler under the skin</li>
                    <li>    Over correction of under correction</li>
                    <li>   Blindness</li>
                    <li> Skin necrosis due to an unidentified intravascular injection of filler.</li>
                </ul>


                <p>Please note that all of the Hyaluronic Acid fillers and Radiesse (CaHA) have an antidote that will dissolve the filler and likely resolve an intravascular injection. </p>
