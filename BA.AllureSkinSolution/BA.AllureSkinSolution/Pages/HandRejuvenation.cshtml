                    <p>
                        As we age, the subcutaneous fat located on the top of our hands decreases. Our skin thins and the veins, tendons and bones become more visible, making our hands look withered and aged. Hand rejuvenation injections restore fullness and elasticity to the hands using dermal fillers. Restylane Lyft & Radiesse are both FDA approved for hand injections and improve the look of aging hands by stimulating collagen, and plumping and hydrating the tissue resulting in supple, younger looking hands.
