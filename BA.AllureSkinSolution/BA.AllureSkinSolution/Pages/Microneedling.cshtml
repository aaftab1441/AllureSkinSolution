                    <p>Microneedling is a minimally invasive skin rejuvenation procedure that involves the use of a device that contains fine needles. These needles are used to puncture the skin at various depths creating micro-injuries that trigger your body’s natural wound repair process and resulting in tighter pores and vibrant, younger-looking skin.  </p>

                <h5>DAY OF PROCEDURE</h5>
                <ul class="list-style-circle">
                    <li>Wash the treatment area thoroughly a few hours after treatment using tepid water and a gentle cleanser to remove any dried serum and other debris such as dried blood. This improves the skin’s appearance and also allows for better absorption of the post-procedure serum.</li>
                    <li>Use after care products as directed by your provider.</li>
                    <li>Do not apply make-up for at least 24 hours. After 24 hours, mineral make up may be applied using a CLEAN brush.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 class="mt-5">THE FOLLOWING 1-3 DAYS</h5>
                <ul class="list-style-circle">
                    <li>Skin will be dry and may feel tight; some flaking is normal. Frequent use of hydrating products will help alleviate dryness.</li>
                    <li>Avoid direct sun exposure for at least 48 hours if possible.</li>
                    <li>Use a physical sunscreen daily.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 class="mt-5">AFTER 5-7 DAYS</h5>
                <ul class="list-style-circle">
                    <li>You may return to your regular skin care products. Vitamin A products are optimal and recommended.</li>
