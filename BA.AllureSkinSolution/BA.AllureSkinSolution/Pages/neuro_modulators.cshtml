                <h3>BOTOX®</h3>
                <p class="my-4">BOTOX® is derived from a neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It prevents the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine causing a flaccid paralysis in and around the muscles that are injected. It used medically to treat a variety of muscular related conditions as well as cosmetically to temporarily soften or completely eliminate wrinkles in certain areas of the face. </p>
                <p class="mb-4">You will start noticing decreased movement in your forehead and brow in 7 to 10 days and complete relaxation of the areas injected in 2 weeks. You will receive a follow up call from our office at 2 weeks to check on you and your results. The average person requires about 40 units of BOTOX® to treat the forehead, glabella and crow’s feet. </p>
                <p class="service-time">30 minutes</p>
                <p class="dull">Lasts approximately 3 months</p>

                <h3>Dysport</h3>
                <p class="my-4">Dysport (abobotulinumtoxinA) is derived from a neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium Botulinum. The mechanism of action is the same as BOTOX®. It is FDA approved and used medically to treat a variety of muscular related conditions as well as cosmetically to temporarily soften or eliminate wrinkles and fine lines. The active protein particles in Dysport are smaller than those in BOTOX® and this allows for greater spreading of the product which may be beneficial when treating a larger area. </p>
                <p class="mb-4">Dysport’s dosing is 3:1 when compared to BOTOX®. So the units necessary to achieve desired results may vary but on average 105 - 135 will treat frown lines, forehead lines and crow’s feet</p>
                <p class="service-time">30 minutes with no down time</p>

                <p class="my-4">Xeomin (incobotulinumtoxinA) is derived from a neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium Botulinum. The mechanism of action is the same as BOTOX® and dysport. Xeomin is FDA approved and used medically to treat a variety of muscular related conditions as well as cosmetically for the treatment of frown lines between the eyes. Unlike dysport and BOTOX®, xeomin has no additives and is referred to as the “naked neurotoxin”. This may decrease the likely-hood of developing a resistance to the effects of Xeomin. </p>
                <p class="mb-4">You will start to notice decreased movement in the treated areas with in 4 days. The average person requires 35 - 45 units to achieve desired results treating frown lines, forehead lines and crow’s feet.</p>
