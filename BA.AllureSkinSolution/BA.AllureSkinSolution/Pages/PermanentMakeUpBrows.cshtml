The fusion of the two helps to create a natural yet finished look. This brow works great for those with less hair or patchy areas within their natural brow in order to give a fuller and more filled out appearance.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Permanent makeup is a great solution for so many reasons! If you have sparse eyebrows, asymmetrical eyebrows, non-existent eyebrows, or if you are simply just tired of filling them in, it is the way to go! Permanent makeup is smudge-proof, sweat-proof and waterproof.  It will save you time and in many cases, money. My aim is to create a natural set of brows that will complement and enhance your beautiful features-not take away from them. </p>
