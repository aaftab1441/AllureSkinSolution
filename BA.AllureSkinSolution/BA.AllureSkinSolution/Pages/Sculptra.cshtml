                <h3>About</h3>
                <p class="my-4">Sculptra® is an FDA approved synthetic filler comprised of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), a substance that stimulates collagen production. It works subtly over time, stimulating your skin’s own natural collagen growth to help restore inner structure and increase facial volume that has been lost due to aging. Because it works gradually, treatment with Sculptra is a series 4 injection sessions 3 to 4 weeks apart. It takes up to 3 months after treatment to see the full effects of Sculptra.  </p>

                <h4>Before Being Treated With Derma Fillers</h4>
                <p>Your skin will be numbed with a topical anesthetic and there is anesthetic in the filler as well. It is normal to experience swelling and bruising for a few days/ 2 weeks after your procedure. To minimize these side effects consider doing these things pre-procedure:</p>
                <ul class="list-style-circle mt-5">
                    <li>Avoid taking aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, st johns wort, omega 3 fatty acids (fish oil) and vitamin e supplements 5 days prior to your procedure</li>
                    <li>Avoid alcohol for 24 hrs prior to your procedure.</li>
                    <li>Consider taking an antihistamine for 2 days before your procedure to decrease swelling.</li>
                    <li>Consider taking oral arnica for 2 days before your procedure to decrease bruising.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Risks Associated with Derma Filler Injections</h4>
                <p>Severe complications from dermal fillers are uncommon, however, we’d like you to be aware of them.  These risks may vary depending on the filler used and include:</p>
                <ul class="list-style-circle my-5">
                    <li>Acne like skin eruptions</li>
                    <li>Asymmetry</li>
                    <li>Bruising and bleeding from the injection site, swelling</li>
                    <li>Damage to the skin that results in a wound and possible scarring</li>
                    <li>Infection and the injection site</li>
                    <li>Lumps or palpable filler under the skin</li>
                    <li>Over correction of under correction</li>
                    <li>Blindness</li>
                    <li>Skin necrosis due to an unidentified intravascular injection of filler.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Please note that all of the Hyaluronic Acid fillers and Radiesse (CaHA) have an antidote that will dissolve the filler and likely resolve an intravascular injection. Consider taking oral Arnica for 2 days before your procedure to decrease bruising.</p>
