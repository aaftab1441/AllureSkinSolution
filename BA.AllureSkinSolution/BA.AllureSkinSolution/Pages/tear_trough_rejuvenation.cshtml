                <h3>Platelet-Rich Plasma</h3>
                <p class="my-4">(PRP) is a concentrated mixture of blood plasma. It is the portion of the blood that contains healing growth factors such as PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), and TGF (transforming growth factor). Plasma is the part of our blood that initiates the coagulation process and aides to speed up the healing process. </p>

                <h4>Growth and healing factors contained in platelet-rich plasma (prp)</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">By utilizing your own plasma there is no risk of allergic reaction, making PRP a very safe method in lower eyelid rejuvenation. PRP has been used in regenerative medicine as a method to rejuvenate and improve wrinkles, folds, and scars on the neck and face, often times allowing patients to avoid surgery or lasers.</p>
                <p>The tear troughs are located at the inner corners of the eye, next to the nose. As we age, the area becomes hollow and dark due to a loss of volume in the area. It can be quite bothersome as the hollowness can give a person a sunken and gaunt look, which adds years to one’s appearance. Utilizing PRP can help to improve the quality and integrity of the skin in this area due to the increased collagen production and blood supply that PRP delivers, which results in a more youthful look. The ability of PRP to stimulate collagen production, while improving skin tone and texture, helps people regain youthful-looking eyes without surgery. Call or stop by to see if you are a candidate for lower eyelid rejuvenation!</p>
